# CSS 2184~ Data-Structures-1



This repository contains implementations of core **Data Structures and Algorithms** concepts covered in my lab sessions. Each week explores a new topic with code examples, ranging from basic arrays to advanced tree and graph operations.

### Topics Covered

1. Basic Searching and Sorting (Arrays)
2. Pointers, Recursion, and Dynamic Memory Allocation
3. Strings and Structures – Concepts and Applications
4. Singly Linked List – Creation and Operations
5. Doubly Linked List – Insertion, Deletion, and Traversal
6. Polynomials using Linked List and Circular List
7. Stacks – Array & Linked List Implementation and Applications
8. Queues – Array & Linked List Implementation and Applications
9. Binary Tree – Creation and Traversals
10. Binary Search Trees & AVL Tree Operations
11. Graph Representation and Traversals

This repo is meant to serve as a reference for lab exercises, practice, and revision of essential **Data Structures** concepts.
